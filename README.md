# Memory Card Game (React)

## Overview

The Memory Card Game is an engaging, interactive web application built with React. It challenges players to test and improve their memory skills by matching pairs of cards. With added background music and video elements, the game offers an immersive experience. This project helped me expand my knowledge of React, particularly in state management, `useEffect` optimization, and integrating multimedia components within a React application.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Flip cards and try not to pick the same card twice!
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Background Music and Videos**: Enhanced user engagement through integrated background music and dynamic video backgrounds.
- **State Management with React Hooks**: Utilized `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for efficient state and side-effect management.
- **Score and Move Tracking**: Real-time tracking of the player's moves and elapsed rounds.
- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**: Option to select different game modes or difficulty levels.
- **Restart and Reset Functionality**: Easily restart the game at any time without page reloads.

## What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- **Optimizing useEffect**: Improved my understanding of the `useEffect` hook, learning how to manage dependencies effectively to prevent unnecessary re-renders and side effects.
- **Enhancing React Skills**: Developed better handling of complex state logic and component interactions within a game context.
- **Integrating Multimedia**: Gained experience in incorporating background music and video elements into a React application, ensuring they synchronize well with the game's state and user interactions.
- **Translating Game Logic to React**: Transitioned traditional JavaScript game logic into React components, leveraging hooks and state for a more seamless and maintainable codebase.
- **Managing Timers and Intervals**: Learned to handle timers within React using `useEffect` and `useRef`, ensuring proper setup and cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
- **Improving User Experience**: Focused on creating an engaging and intuitive user interface, enhancing animations and feedback based on user actions.
- **Code Organization and Readability**: Enhanced code structure by organizing components into separate folders and keeping each file under 80 lines of code—many around 30 lines—to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Enhanced my debugging skills by using React DevTools and other techniques to identify and fix issues efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI and managing the component lifecycle.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core language for building functionality and handling user interactions.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface and ensuring a responsive layout.
- **Vite**: For fast development and efficient bundling.
- **GitHub Pages**: For project deployment and hosting.
- **React Hooks**: Specifically `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` for state management and side effects.
- **Multimedia Assets**: Audio and video files for background music and video elements.
